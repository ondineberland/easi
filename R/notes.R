#Run easi.R
#Run intermediate blocs.R ## In summary, the intermediate.blocs function processes an input object to recover and calculate various coefficients and sums related to equations. These calculations are based on the "EASI made EASIER" methodology by PENDAKUR (2008). The function returns a list containing all the recovered and calculated values.##
